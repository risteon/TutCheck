TutCheck
========

## Summary

TutCheck is a small script that checks if a website changes during runtime. This can be useful when a registration or a result is unlocked online without a specific time. When the website changes, an alert sound (.wav file) plays (tested under Mac OS X).

## Usage

Simply run `python tutcheck.py` in terminal.
