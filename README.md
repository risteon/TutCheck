TutCheck (server edition)
=========================

## Summary

TutCheck is a small script that checks if a website changes during runtime. This can be useful when a registration or a result is unlocked online without a specific time. When the website changes, a mail is sent when the setup in the sourcecode is correct.

## Usage

Simply run `python tutcheck.py` in terminal.
